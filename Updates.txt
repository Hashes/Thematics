Combat : the combat will be single specialty at a time, meaning that you can't be both mage and soldier. 
         Will be added later during the project. The same will apply for Npcs.


Entity : The entity represents both a player and a npc. Their similarities are handled as an entity, 
         while their different aspects are handled separatly.


Input/Output : This will be used to save an object (usually the player) in a file and be read later
	       to load player information.
